      <h1>A little about me:</h1>
      <p>I am currently a first year Master’s student at the University of Michigan School of Information. My main focus in my master’s program is data science, big data analytics, and social computational science. I also attended the University of Michigan as an undergraduate student. I got my degree in economics and psychology and hope to continue to research within these topics. I am hoping to work in the technology industry and use my skills with data manipulation, data aggregation, and data analysis to create models and algorithms that can be helpful in understanding data and help make decisions based on the data. </p>
      <p>I am hoping to gain more of an understanding of how data can affect the world around. I would like to someday make that difference and be able to utilize the advancements in technology to further the growth of our society. While I do have professional goals in the data field, I would also like to grow my music career as well. I want to gain traction as a producer and DJ! These are just hobbies for now, but I would like to see these things become a reality too.</p>
      <p>I am originally from the Chicago land area and my family still resides there. I am a chicago boy at heart, but I found my second home in Ann Arbor. I love pizza, playing basketball, working out, composing music, and most importantly my dog Cookie!</p>
